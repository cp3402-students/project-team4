## Organising the Site for Future Updates & Maintenance:
With respect to those who are taking over site development going forward, the focus for them with regard to Wordpress features will be the plugins that we have installed for the site.

### How the Site is Organised:
The organisation of WordPress features abides by the default format, (outlined below) and includes plugins that implement additional features to the WordPress user interface:

#### Posts
All posts - This is the main panel for the posts feature, and is where the created posts are shown in alphabetical order by default. If the user wishes to make modifications to the content of a particular category, they can do so by adjusting the category filter to, for example, the _announcements_ category, then click the filter button.

Add New Post - This panel automatically creates a new post for the user to begin inserting post content into.

Categories - This is a variation of the main panel that features the created categories, as well as the ability to create categories and fill in relevant information, such as the name, parent category, and description.

Tags - This is another variation of the main panel, which features the created tags, as well as the ability to create tags and fill in relevant information, such as the name, parent category, and description.

#### Media
Library - This is where uploaded media such as images and videos are found on the site, which features the ability to filter that which is presented. This will be useful in case the user has increased the quantity of uploaded media, to the extent of making it difficult to locate a precise item in the library.

Add New Media File - This panel is where the user can either drag-and-drop the media that they wish to add to the library, or browse the files on their computer to make additions.

#### Pages
All Pages - This is the main panel for the pages feature, and is where the created pages are shown in alphabetical order by default.

Add New Page - This panel automatically creates a new page for the user to begin inserting page content into.

#### Comments
Since we have not utilised this feature in the production of this site, the user is free to ignore this feature unless they intend to make use of it.

#### WPForms Lite
This functionality is an additional feature make available by the 'WPForms Lite' plugin, and is what allows the user to view and manage the contact forms utilised in the site.

#### Appearance
Themes - This is the panel where the available themes for the site are located, which includes the ability to interact with our custom theme, or browse for other themes to try out.

Customise - This is the panel where the user can make changes to various site features such as the utilised theme, site identity, colours, as well as many others.

Widgets - This is the panel where the user can interact with and modify the available widgets, predominately the sidebar.

Menus - This is the panel where the user can create and make changes to the menu navigation presented at the top of the site, amongst other menus that the user can create on this panel.

Header - This is used for quick access to the header image feature as part of the Customise panel.

Background - This is used for quick access to the background image feature as part of the Customise panel.

Theme Check - This panel is the additional feature made available by the 'Theme Check' plugin, and is what allows the user to view and manage the theme integrity, making sure that it is ready for use on the live site.

Theme File Editor - This is where files pertaining to the theme can be modified. However, since we have utilised IDE's and other backend tools in the production of this site, modifications via this method are not recommended for the user.

Add New Plugin - This panel is where the user can go, to install plugins that they wish to use for the site.

Plugin File Editor - This is where files pertaining to plugins can be configured. However, this functionality has not been employed by us in the making of this site.

It is for these reasons that it is not recommended for the user to interact with this functionality, unless the user knows what they are doing.
