## Description:

This repository contains the U3A Online custom theme, which is designed to be for Elderly people who want the ability to learn new things, but not the ability to have to take exams or do assignments.

For this theme we have been able to implement the following features:

- Custom logo and Header Image
- Header and Footer Navigation Menus
- 'Log In' and 'Become A Member' call-to-action buttons with customisable links. 

The theme uses customizer.php for the header and footer outputs. The ability to select custom options is done through the WordPress Customizer.
